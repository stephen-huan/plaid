# Plaid Keyboard

The Plaid keyboard is a 4x12 ortholinear made from through hole parts,
designed by [hsgw](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid).

My contributions include the design of an acrylic guard,
figuring out how to use an aluminium plate,
and a modified way to put the keyboard together.
I also include a way to flash the bootloader to the atmega328p with ArudinoISP.
USB-C variant of the keyboard TODO.

## Pictures

Completed Plaid without acrylic guard or plate, and with an old fuse component.
Notice the alignment problems (right space is higher than left space,
"j" key („Åæ on the Hiragana keycaps) is also higher than its surroundings).

and acrylic guard from Ponoko. Notice the better alignment and the new fuse.
