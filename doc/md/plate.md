# Plate

Upload `hardware/plate/GRID_planck_hipro.dxf`
to [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/).
Recommended material is 5052 Aluminium, 1.6mm thick.

DXF file taken from [LaserBoost](https://www.laserboost.com/plates-planck),
the Planck Grid Hi-Pro plate. The Planck is a different PCB, but the dimensions
and screw hole placement are the same.

What are the advantages of using a plate?

1. Switches are aligned, so everything is nice and straight.
2. Flex is noticeably reduced (without a plate, pressing down will bend
the PCB. With a plate, the plate absorbs most of the force).
3. Dust and other particulate accumulates on the plate instead of the PCB.

## Soldering switches
Press switches into the plate until it clicks.
Make sure alignment is correct.
One switch at the bottom row and 7 switches from the left will be facing in the
opposite direction as the others, because of the PCB design -
this allows the PCB to support both the grid and MIT layout.

Once all the switches are pressed into the plate, proceed to solder as usual.
I recommend soldering the four switches at the corners of the plate first
to guarantee that the plate is flat and aligned with the PCB.

Plate fits onto the Plaid PCB although it's a Planck plate!
Soldered switches, note that the hole on the switch on the bottom row
and 7 from the left has its hole pointing upwards compared to the other switches
pointing downwards, as stated above.
