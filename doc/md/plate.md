Recommended material is 5052 Aluminium, 1.6mm thick.
DXF file taken from [LaserBoost](https://www.laserboost.com/plates-planck),
the Planck Grid Hi-Pro plate. The Planck is a different PCB, but the dimensions
and screw hole placement are the same.

What are the advantages of using a plate?

1. Switches are aligned, so everything is nice and straight.
2. Flex is noticeably reduced (without a plate, pressing down will bend
the PCB. With a plate, the plate absorbs most of the force).
3. Dust and other particulate accumulates on the plate instead of the PCB.
